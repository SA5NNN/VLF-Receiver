# BJT Buffer amplifier circuit

The buffer amplifier creates a relatively high impedance input and low impedance output. This avoids the problem in electronics when a low impedance
loads the output of another circuit such that it does not function as designed. In other words it provides impedance matching.

There are several variations and you can also use MOSFETs or OP-amps, BJT is not going to going to be able to compete with MOSFET or OP-amps as they
have naural very high input impedance, but ofter BJT is good enough and certainly very simple to do and cheap as well.
