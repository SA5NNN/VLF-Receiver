# VLF Receiver

KiCad schematics and docs for a VLF receiver aimed at 17.2 kHz SAQ reception.


This project started out with me noticing the UNESCO world heritage Grimeton https://grimeton.org/ facility south of Gothenburg Sweden. Built in the 1920’s the facility communicated with New York where a similar station was located at Radio Central, Rocky Point, Long Island. The station is the only station operating an Alexanderson alternator transmitter. The alternator generates a sine wave at 17.2 kHz (17442 m wavelength) at a power of 200 kW. It uses a large field to house six 127 m high antennas. It is very difficult to get antennas to be efficient at these low frequencies (maybe a few percent actually radiates, the rest turns into heat) and therefore interesting to see how much I can hear from my QTH in Sweden.
My radio friends in SK5LF started by designing whip antennas, so it seemed a good idea to try something else. Whip antennas receive the electric fields, so why not design something that connects to the magnetic field? The obvious starting point www.vlf.it: http://www.vlf.it/looptheo7/looptheo7.htm. This page concludes that the mass of copper in the air is the most important factor for a strong signal. It turns out getting the material is not trivial and building the construction is not easy either. So, the project got left on the back burner over covid. At summer 2022 I decided to see if I could scale down the project and actually do something! I found Paul’s page https://www.prinz.nl/SAQ.html where he designs a receiver for a computer’s soundcard using a ferrite rod. These components are much easier to use as they do not require much, if any, building. I missed the July transmission but had a plan.
I used a signal generator to generate 17.2 kHz sine wave and output it to a small piece of wire (10 cm or so), this was detectable using my VNA! That means I can test my stuff before the actual transmission, quite a feat! As a receiver I decided to use my SDR radio, a SDRplay RSPdx. It has special filtering to allow for VLF and a port for sub 200 MHz. The SDR software can be used to record not only the sound, but the entire sampled radio data if I wanted to. Convenient as I do not know morse so have to do a lot of decoding work after the reception.
Paul’s design builds on a design from Broesel, Villach, Austria, that he simplified a bit. The design as a resonance circuit with the ferrite rod and capacitance provided by three varactors (or varicaps), then a MOSFET for amplification.
The ferrite rod took an eternity to google, had to wade through an ocean of commercial crap from all over the world. But in the end a German company http://www.amidon.de/ had a rod of the correct material and dimensions. Also an Italian company could provide the varactors https://www.rf-microwave.com/en/philips/bb112/varicap-diode/bb112/. The ferrite rod took 1.5 weeks to arrive and the varactors took 2 days (!!). My “local” supplier had the rest, including one of the MOSFETs Paul had tested and that worked. The MOSFET was 2SK241 https://www.electrokit.com/produkt/2sk241-spa-transistor-fet-n-ch-20v-30ma/ and was sold as surplus. Yes, availability of the components may be problematic since these stuff don’t get built much commercially any more and the hobbyists do not build them to often either, but they do exist!
You may want to look at the schematics at this stage, download and install KiCad, then download the KiCad project files from this github repository and you can follow along.
I made some changes to Paul’s original design due to components, final inductance and the choice of receiver, check his design instead if you want to use a soundcard.
